## Get Started

You can install Eustia using Node Package Manager(**npm**).

```bash
npm install -g eustia
```

Suppose you are doing a new project, and create a file name **index.html**. Then you want to use **trim** method in it, so you just write the code down as follows.

```html
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <title>Eustia</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
    var projectName = _.trim(' Eustia ');
    // Some code...
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Inside the same folder, run command:

```bash
eustia build index.html -o util.js
```

After that, just include the generated library in you html file. This is it, everything is just done, so simple!

```html
<script src="util.js"></script>
```

To view what methods Eustia currently supports, view the [src](https://github.com/liriliri/eustia/tree/master/src) directory. What's more, the project is a perfect example of using Eustia whose [utility library](https://github.com/liriliri/eustia/blob/master/lib/util.js) is generated by itself.
